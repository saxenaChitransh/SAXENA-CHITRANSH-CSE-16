  <p><b><font size="4">A hub for knowledge, technology, and community events-</font></b></p>
  <p><font size="4">The city has officially opened its new downtown public library, a $50 million project 
  that aims to provide not just books, but also digital resources, study spaces, and 
  cultural programs for residents. Officials say the library represents a major investment 
  in education, technology, and community development.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4">The five-story building includes quiet study rooms, a children’s reading corner, 
  free computer access, and a rooftop garden. In addition, the library hosts a digital 
  lab where visitors can learn coding, use 3D printers, and attend workshops on robotics 
  and artificial intelligence. “This library is more than shelves of books—it’s a place 
  where people of all ages can discover, learn, and create,” said the city mayor at the 
  opening ceremony.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4">Community members have praised the project, especially because membership is free. 
  Many residents also noted that the library will provide a safe, educational space 
  for students after school hours. The opening day attracted more than 2,000 visitors, 
  and librarians expect even more as word spreads.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4">Along with its physical resources, the library offers access to thousands of e-books 
  and online journals. Residents can also register for free classes on topics such as 
  financial literacy, language learning, and career development. Officials hope the 
  library will become a central meeting place for the community, where education and 
  innovation go hand in hand.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4">The library project is part of the city’s larger “Smart City” plan, which includes 
  upgrading schools, expanding internet access, and creating more green spaces. If 
  successful, the city plans to open two more modern libraries in other districts by 2030.</font></p>
